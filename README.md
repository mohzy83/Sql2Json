# Sql2Json

## Current Version 1.0.0

for dotnet core 1.0, 1.1 and .NET Framework 4.0 and higher


## Nuget
[Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sql2Json.Core/)
```
PM> Install-Package QueryAsJson.Core
```


## Description
This library helps to format query results (from a database) as JSON with arbitrary structure (including nested objects).

Some database engines lack the ability to query tables an return the results directly as JSON (e.g. Oracle). This can be accomplished with QueryAsJson by an intuitve API based on anonymous types. 

The primary goal of this library is performance. 

With this library it is possible to skip the step to add an OR-Mapping Layer just to generate JSON.

The Library supports all databases with an ado.net provider.

Basicly this library was created to test some features of dotnet core.



## Usage

### If you have a database with the following content

```sql
INSERT INTO customer (id, sname, fname, BDAY, ADR_STREET, ADR_CITY) VALUES(1, 'Meyers','Mike','1983-10-31 00:00:00.000', 'Street 1', 'Las Vegas');
INSERT INTO invoices (id, inv_date, amount, customer_id) VALUES(1, '2015-10-12 15:43:00.000', 500.2, 1);
INSERT INTO invoices (id, inv_date, amount, customer_id) VALUES(2, '2016-05-09 15:43:00.000', 155.2, 1);
INSERT INTO orders (id, ordernumber, articles, customer_id) VALUES (1,'O-1001','Book 1, Book 2',1);
INSERT INTO orders (id, ordernumber, articles, customer_id) VALUES (2,'O-1002','CD Burner, Usb stick 32Gb',1);
```

### Define a mapping
```csharp
var mappingDef = Define.QueryWithNestedResults("cid",
@"select c.id as cid, c.sname, c.fname, c.BDAY, c.ADR_STREET, c.ADR_CITY, i.id as iid, i.inv_date, i.amount, o.articles, o.id as oid
from customer c
left join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
left join invoices i on c.id = i.customer_id"
,
    new
    {
        Id = Define.Column("cid"),
        SurName = Define.Column("sname"),
        FirstName = Define.Column("fname"),
        Birthday = Define.Column("BDAY"),
        Address = new
        {
            Street = Define.Column("ADR_STREET"),
            City = Define.Column("ADR_CITY"),
        },
        Invoices = Define.NestedResults("iid",
            new
            {
                InvoiceId = Define.Column("iid"),
                Inv_Date = Define.Column(),
                TotalAmount = Define.Column("amount"),
            }
        ),
        Orders = Define.NestedResults("oid",
            new
            {
                OrderId = Define.Column("oid"),
                ArticleSummary = Define.Column("articles"),
            }
        )
    }
);
```
### Than execute the mapping against the database and generate the JSON
```csharp
// Execute mapping
var connection = new SqliteConnection("test.db"); // SQLite or any other connection
var engine = new MappingEngine(connection, mappingDef.Compile());
using (var filestream = new FileStream("output.json", FileMode.CreateNew)) {
    engine.ExecuteMapping(filestream, null);
}
```
### The output looks like this

```json
[{
    "Id": 1,
    "SName": "Meyers",
    "FirstName": "Mike",
    "LastUpdate": "2017-03-01",
    "Birthday": "1983-10-31 00:00:00.000",
    "Address": {
        "Street": "Street 1",
        "City": "Las Vegas"
    },
    "Invoices": [{
            "InvoiceId": 1,
            "Inv_Date": "2015-10-12 15:43:00.000",
            "TotalAmount": 500.2
        }, {
            "InvoiceId": 2,
            "Inv_Date": "2016-05-09 15:43:00.000",
            "TotalAmount": 155.2
        }
    ],
    "Orders": [{
            "OrderId": 1,
            "ArticleSummary": "Book 1, Book 2"
        }, {
            "OrderId": 2,
            "ArticleSummary": "CD Burner, Usb stick 32Gb"
        }
    ]
}]
```

## Save mapping

It is possible to save the mapping defintion as external json for later use.

```csharp
var mappingDef = Define.QueryWithNestedResults("id","select * from customer");
mappingDef.Compile().Save("mapping.json");
```

## Load mapping

Load a saved mapping from file and execute the mapping.

```csharp

// Load mapping
var loadedCompiledMapping = MappingFileManager.Load(@"mapping.json");
// execute it
var engine = new MappingEngine(connection, loadedCompiledMapping);
...
```
